# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 27, 2026**

OTASK ("we," "our," or "the App") is a personal time management application designed to help you plan, track, and visualize your daily schedule. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and the choices you have.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Data You Create

When you use OTASK, you create personal data including:

- **Tasks & Reminders** — titles, start/end times, completion status, and associated dates.
- **Routines** — recurring task templates with titles, times, and repeat schedules.
- **Daily Notes** — free-form text notes you write for each day.

**All of this data is stored locally on your device.** We do not transmit, upload, or have access to your tasks, routines, or notes.

### 1.2 Subscription Information

OTASK uses **RevenueCat** (a third-party service) to manage in-app subscriptions. When you subscribe, RevenueCat processes the transaction through Apple's App Store. RevenueCat may collect:

- An anonymous user identifier (generated automatically; not linked to your name or email).
- Purchase history and subscription status.
- Device type, OS version, and app version (for diagnostics).

RevenueCat does **not** receive any of your task data, notes, or personal content. For more information, please refer to [RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/).

### 1.3 Notifications

OTASK sends **local notifications** (task start, task end, daily summary) that are scheduled and delivered entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to any server.

### 1.4 Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** require account creation, sign-in, or registration.
- We do **not** collect your name, email address, phone number, or any personal identifiers.
- We do **not** use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs.
- We do **not** use cookies or similar tracking technologies.
- We do **not** access your contacts, photos, camera, microphone, or location.

## 2. How We Use Information

- **Local data** (tasks, routines, notes) is used solely to provide the App's functionality on your device.
- **Subscription data** is used only to verify your subscription status and unlock premium features.

## 3. Data Storage & Security

- All task, routine, and note data is stored on-device using Apple's SwiftData framework.
- Data stays on your device and is protected by your device's security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID).
- We do not operate servers that store your personal content.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The only third-party service used by OTASK is:

| Service | Purpose | Data Shared |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **RevenueCat** | Subscription management | Anonymous ID, purchase status, device info |

We do not share your data with advertisers, data brokers, or any other third parties.

## 5. Children's Privacy

OTASK does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App does not require account creation and stores all data locally on the device.

## 6. Your Rights & Choices

- **Delete your data**: You can delete any task, routine, or note within the App at any time. Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data.
- **Manage notifications**: You can enable or disable notifications in the App's settings or through iOS Settings.
- **Manage your subscription**: You can manage or cancel your subscription through your Apple ID account settings.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page reflects the most recent revision. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
